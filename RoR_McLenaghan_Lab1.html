                In the late 1970s, as an exodus of refugees began in Vietnam, some 300,000 ethnic Han people crossed from Vietnam into southern China.
                Unlike refugees from other countries, these people were largely welcomed in China, and were provided with housing and jobs.
                While tensions do exist between the refugees and their Chinese hosts, who still command higher paying work and live in more modern apartments,
                relations between the groups is largely peaceful.
                The integration of the Han Vietnamese, however, is an exception to China's standard refugee policy; the country consistently rebuffs
                refugees from neighboring Burma, for ethnic reasons, and North Korea, for political ones.

                As more Vietnamese took to the seas, their arrivals in countries around the South China Sea strained developing countries' resources.
                Stories began to circulate of authorities pushing migrants and refugees back into the ocean.  This contrasted with the relative 
                success of the UN-sponsored Orderly Departure Program, put in place in 1979.  While this program gave people a 'legal' way to leave 
                Vietnam, tens of thousands of migrants and refugees continued to get into boats through the early 1980's.

                In 1995, as Vietnam stabilized and Hong Kong prepared to return refugees to their home country,
                Congressional Republicans drafted legislation that would have granted asylum to an additional tranche
                of refugees.  Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong, eager to move to the United States, rioted, in an attempt
                to stop their return to Vietnam.

                In 1989, a decade after most refugees fled, China and the UNHCR made the first attempts at voluntary repatriation of 
                refugees and migrants to their home country.  During the previous year, China changed their Vietnamese refugee policy, evaluating
                each individual's refugee claims on a case-by-case basis, rather than granting them refugee status as a complete class.
                Those who were classified as migrants, rather than refugees, were not eligible for resettlement in a third country,
                and a handful decided instead to return home.
